## Hello world!

Hello. This is a test page, generated by the Blake Blazor static site generator. Like it?

## FAQ

1. Why?

I...honestly can't remember!

2. What's next?

Templating system...other features...I forget. I have a roadmap though.

3. How do I use it?

Eventually it will be a standalone CLI tool, you'll be able to use it like this:

```bash
blake init
blake bake
dotnet run
```

## Roadmap

```bash
blake new --template my-template
blake new -t a-different-template
```
